<h4 id="about">About</h4>
<p>I am focused on helping nonprofits to drive social innovation through storytelling and digital media. Born in Mexico and raised in Colorado, I have spent the majority of my career working for news organizations and nonprofits. I am also passionate about journalism and love working on deeply reported stories focused on the people and communities that are shaped by public policy.</p>
<p>My experience includes working as a reporter and editor for The Associated Press, Newsday, Herald News, amNewYork, and The Bloomsbury Review. My stories have appeared in The Guardian, Next City, The Washington Post, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I oversaw the development of <a href="https://www.floodhelpny.org/">FloodHelpNY.org</a>, the City of New York’s award-winning portal for information on flooding and flood risk. I also led the communications campaign for New York&#39;s COVID relief program, which helped tens of thousands of people keep their homes after the pandemic.</p>
<p>I currently work with national nonprofits and media organizations at <a href="https://www.theleadpr.com/">The Lead PR</a>, a small Manhattan-based firm.</p>
