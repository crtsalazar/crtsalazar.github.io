#### About

I am focused on helping nonprofits to drive social innovation through storytelling and digital media. Born in Mexico and raised in Colorado, I have spent the majority of my career working for news organizations and nonprofits. I am also passionate about journalism, and love working on deeply reported stories focused on the people and communities that are shaped by public policy.

My experience includes working as a reporter and editor for The Assocated Press, Newsday, Herald News, amNewYork, and The Bloomsbury Review. My stories have appeared in The Guardian, Next City, The Washington Post, and elsewhere.

I oversaw the development of [FloodHelpNY.org](https://www.floodhelpny.org/), the City of New York’s award-winning portal for information on flooding and flood risk. I also led the communications campaign for New York's COVID relief program, which helped tens of thousands of people to keep their homes after the pandemic.

I currently work with national nonprofits and media organizations at [The Lead PR](https://www.theleadpr.com/), a small Manhattan-based firm.
